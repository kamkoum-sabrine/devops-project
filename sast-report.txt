          When running containers in Kubernetes, it's important to ensure that they  are  
          properly secured to prevent privilege escalation attacks.  One potential        
          vulnerability is when a container is allowed to run  applications as the root   
          user, which could allow an attacker to gain  access to sensitive resources. To  
          mitigate this risk, it's recommended to  add a `securityContext` to the         
          container, with the parameter `runAsNonRoot`  set to `true`. This will ensure   
          that the container runs as a non-root user,  limiting the damage that could be  
          caused by any potential attacks. By  adding a `securityContext` to the container
          in your Kubernetes pod, you can  help to ensure that your containerized         
          applications are more secure and  less vulnerable to privilege escalation       
          attacks.

          In Kubernetes, each pod runs in its own isolated environment with its own set of 
          security policies. However, certain container images may contain `setuid` or     
          `setgid` binaries that could allow an attacker to perform privilege escalation   
          and gain access to sensitive resources. To mitigate this risk, it's recommended  
          to add a `securityContext` to the container in the pod, with the parameter       
          `allowPrivilegeEscalation` set to `false`. This will prevent the container from  
          running any privileged processes and limit the impact of any potential attacks.  
          By adding a `securityContext` to your Kubernetes pod, you can help to ensure that
          your containerized applications are more secure and less vulnerable to privilege 
          escalation attacks.
